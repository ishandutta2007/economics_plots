This repository is a curated collection of Python scripts that generate insightful plots, charts, and animations focused on global economic, demographic, and geopolitical trends. It serves as a tool for visual data analysis, making complex datasets accessible and understandable.

## 📊 Gallery

Here are a few examples of the visualizations this repository can generate.

*An animated comparison of GDP per capita (PPP) between China and the USA.*
*(This animation would be generated by `china_vs_usa_gdppc_ppp_animate.py`)*

## 🌐 Topics Covered

The scripts cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

### Macroeconomics & Geopolitics
- **GDP & Growth:** Comparisons between major economies and blocs (BRICS vs. G7).
- **Economic Indicators:** GDP per capita (PPP), foreign direct investment (FDI), and trade.
- **Country Comparisons:** In-depth visual analysis of economies like the USA, China, India, Germany, and Japan.
- **Resource Distribution:** Analysis of natural resources and energy production/costs.

### Technology & Corporate
- **Big Tech:** Employee headcount and revenue trends (FAANG, Big Semiconductor).
- **AI & SaaS:** Tracking the growth of AI startups and the SaaS industry.
- **Platform Wars:** Comparisons between major digital platforms (YouTube vs. TikTok).

### Demographics & Social Trends
- **Population:** Density and growth comparisons.
- **Workforce:** Labor force participation and wage comparisons.
- **Social Indicators:** Household incomes and education statistics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up your local environment and run the scripts.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **FFmpeg** (for saving video animations). You can download it from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your system's PATH.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mr-Innovation/economics_plots.git
    cd economics_plots
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    It is recommended to create a `requirements.txt` file. Based on the scripts, the essential libraries are:
    ```
    pandas
    matplotlib
    pandas-datareader
    ```
    You can install them directly:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib pandas-datareader
    ```

### Running the Scripts

Navigate to the repository directory and run any of the Python scripts:

```bash
# Example: Generate the animated GDP comparison
python china_vs_usa_gdppc_ppp_animate.py

# Example: Generate the plot for FAANG headcount
python FAANG_headcount.py
```

The output (e.g., `.png` images or `.mp4` videos) will be saved in the root directory.
